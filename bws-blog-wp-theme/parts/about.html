  <p>I created the Bannister Web Services blog as I didn't have a good method for recording what I was learning as my development skills progressed. I often found myself running into the same problems several times before the solution would be fixed in my mind, and was searching the internet for the same answers over and over. This didn't matter too much for simple or common problems where the answers are readily available across the internet, but I was wasting a lot of time trying to solve more complex situations. The posts I write here are intended to tie together existing resources in a way that I find to be logical, rather than to be a comprehensive educational resource. However, I hope that at least some of what I write will become useful to other developers, and prevent others from encountering the same problems and misunderstandings.</p>
